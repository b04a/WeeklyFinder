# WeeklyFinder

Hi all, I have implemented an application called WeeklyFinder. 

It takes 3 values (day, month and year) and in turn outputs a value, namely what day of the week it was on that day. 

The app helps users find out, for example, what day of the week their birthday will be.

(Implementation code in the project folder)
